## Application Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up and run the application. The application consists of two main parts: the client and the backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Node.js

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone git@github.com:the-sin14/seng-513-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd [Your_Repository_Name]
```


## Setting up the Client

1. Open a new terminal for setting up the client.
2. Navigate to the client directory:
```
cd client
```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Setting up the Backend

1. Open another new terminal for setting up the backend.
2. Navigate to the backend directory:

```
cd backend
```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```


## Running the Application

### Client

1. In the client terminal, start the client application:
```
npm run dev
```
2. The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend

1. In the backend terminal, start the backend server:
```
npm run dev
```
2. The backend server will be running on port 5000

## Interacting with the Application

Once both the client and backend are running, you can interact with the system using the client interface at `http://localhost:5173`.
